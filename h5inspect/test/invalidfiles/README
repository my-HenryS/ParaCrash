This is for all known invalid HDF5 files. h5check should reject them.

invalid_sym.h5: file with duplicate and out-of-order symbols
    a) Create a file which is the same as "rank_dsets_empty.h5"
    b) Use "h5debug" to find the following information:
	1) the heap location for root group symbol table entry
	   -- h5debug invalid_sym.h5
	2) the address of heap data 
	   -- h5debug invalid_sym.h5 680
	   -- the output indicates that the address of heap data is 9504
    c) Use fwrite() to change the symbol "dataset_3" to "dataset_4" 

invalid_grps.h5: file with invalid version in link message that resides in fractal heap
    a) Create a file which is similar to "new_grat.h5"
    b) Use "h5debug" to find the following information:
	1) the root group object header address
	   -- h5debug invalid_grps.h5
	2) the fractal heap address in the link message
	   -- h5debug invalid_sym.h5 48
	3) the fractal heap's root address
	   -- h5debug invalid_sym.h5 1718
	4) the fractal heap's direct block address
	   -- h5debug invalid_sym.h5 14339 1718 1
	5) display the fractal heap's direct block
	   -- h5debug invalid_sym.h5 13827 1718 512
    c) Use fwrite() to change the version number of one link message in the
	fractal heap direct block (13827+291=14118) to 0.
    d) Use fwrite() to change the checksum of the fractal heap direct block
	(13827+17=13844) from 1160659341 to 374212020.  This is done to
	reflect the version change and to allow h5check to continue validating
	the message so the expected error can occur.
