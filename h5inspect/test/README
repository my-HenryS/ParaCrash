README
------
The current prototype for the test files generator is composed of the files:

testgen.h
testgen.c

Installation
------------
make		Builds the testgen tool and runs it to generate the test files.
./testgen	Generates all test files.
make check	Runs all tests.


Extra notes
-----------
The makefile uses h5cc to build the testgen tool by default.  If h5cc is not
in your $PATH or you wish to build the tool differently (e.g., using a special
version of h5cc or even your own "cc ... -lhdf5 ..." command), edit $CC in
makefile.

The test generator creates files and datasets with features available by default
in the HDF5 library. To test features not included by default, the user must 
define certain macros. For instance, to test the external filter szip, the user must define the macro HAVE_SZIP.
