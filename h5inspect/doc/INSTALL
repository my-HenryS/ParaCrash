Instructions for the Installation of H5check Software
=====================================================

========
Build:
========
Assuming gcc, gmake and h5cc are in your $PATH, just do
    % ./configure
    % gmake

The default compiler and HDF5 library compiler are set to gcc and h5cc.
If you want to use a different C compiler and/or h5cc command, do
    % gmake CC=gcc H5CC=$mypath/h5cc

To set different compiler flags use CFLAGS variable, e.g.
    % env CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
This command will set the compiling to "gcc -O2".

============
Run tests:
============
To run the test suite,
    % gmake check

==========
Install:
==========
To install the tool and the library
    % gmake install

These go to h5check/{bin,lib} of the built directory by default.  If you want
to install it somewhere else like /usr/software/{bin,lib},
    % gmake prefix=/usr/software install

=======
Notes:
=======
If the h5check executable cannot handle files larger than 2GB, check for
a solution in the known problems section of the file RELEASE.txt.
