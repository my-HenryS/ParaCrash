    1. Fix for chicago bug from master_REUTERS_ASIA.h5.bad:
	Add callbacks to validate indexed group and indexed attribute messages
    2. Add warnings for coding that is not implemented yet
    3. Turn assert into a validation check in HF_man_read(): fix for
	ahmcoef_aix.nc (from bug #1755)
    4. Update version # to be the same format specification number

    Fixed bug for Chicago developers: duplicate symbol name and symbol name out of order.
    Modified and cleaned up coding (particularly on error reporting).

    Bug fix:
	Last mod to set H5CC does not work.
	Need to fix it so that configure.ac will set and export the
	hdf5 compile command variables and config/commence.am will
	use them accordingly.

    Improvement:
	prefix default (install directory) is /usr/local. This causes problem and sometimes
	accidents during development stage when "make install" is tested.
	Set prefix default (install directory) to a directory in the build area.
	This also allows multiple src-dir builds within one host.

    Improve configure process:
    Problem:
    The package needs h5cc to compile the test generation program to generate
    test files. Configure (config/commence.am) used to hardcode the h5cc tool
    as in $bindir/h5cc which was rarely true.
    Solution:
    I changed it to just use "h5cc" which uses the bigger $PATH scope.
    One can still use the old way of "make H5CC=$mypath/h5cc".

    Bug fix: ID 1650
    Here is a quick list of the problems and actions I took.
    These three files are installed by the current version:
	bin/h5check    OK. Kept as is.

	bin/testgen   	Incorrect since it generates test files and is not a
			user tool.  I have removed it from the install list.

	lib/libh5check.a  
		  Though the implementation design provides the ability
		  that this library can be used by user applications
		  but it is pre-mature to install it because the
		  related header file is not installed and no API
		  definition document exists yet, I think. Therefore, I
		  am removing it from the install list.

- 2009-05-08 by vchoi
    Fixed bug #1557: checked for null pointer in check_lheap() of h5checker.c.

- 2008-07-10 by vchoi
    Fixed a bug for 1.6: validate the # of messages.

- 2008-04-15 by vchoi
    1. src/h5checkerV2_0.c: fixed problem when decoding free-space section list.
    2. test/testgen.c: some coding in progress (#ifdef NOTYET)
